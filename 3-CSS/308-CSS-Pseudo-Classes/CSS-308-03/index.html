         <h3>Nikhil Chinapa</h3>
        <p>To say that Nikhil Chinapa has donned many an avatar during his career, is like saying it snows in Alaska; a bit of an understatement. He morphs from DJ to VJ to MC to Music Promoter to Festival Director —some of his best known avatars — with amazing fluidity.</p>
        <p>He studied Architecture and graduated with a Thesis in Hospital Design. A year later and for reasons that scientists are still trying to understand, Nikhil joined MTV. He said, “I think it’ll be fun.” For once, he was right.</p>
        <p>At MTV, Nikhil has hosted almost every show the channel has aired. From MTV Select – MTV’s longest running show, (it aired continuously for 10 years) to being the host of Splitsvilla, a judge on Roadies as well as Rock On and now host of MTV Mashups.</p>
        <p>Nikhil’s Mom still thinks he’s an idiot though and should get a real job.</p>
        <p>As a popular VJ, Nikhil got to spend a lot of time around his first love, music. In 2001, a conversation between friends resulted in the launch of Submerge — India’s first, and now largest Indian Electronic Dance Music (EDM) company in India.</p>
        <p>By now, Nikhil had begun to DJ professionally and plays, well… whatever he feels like. His sets are moody, varied, often erratic but usually fun. Most of his sets feature frantic foot-stomping and the random flailing of arms – sometimes by him. They also feature music – the kind that has a repetitive monotonous beat and is best enjoyed at dangerous decibel levels.</p>
        <p>Nikhil was also the co-founder of Sunburn. He is now the Festival Curator and partner of Vh1 Supersonic, Goa’s brand new beach music festival.</p>
